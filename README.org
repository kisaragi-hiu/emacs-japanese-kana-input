* An attempt at a Kana input method for Emacs

** Features

- かな入力
- 変換機能 (内蔵の =japanese= 入力と同じ)
- Kで文を平仮名と片假名の間で変換 (内蔵の =japanese= 入力と同じ)

** Issues

- I'm pretty sure this doesn't yet work on an actual JIS keyboard
- I'm not a native Japanese speaker
- The name is maybe not the best?

** Install

Install this package with eg. Straight:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(straight-use-package '(japanese-kana :repo "https://github.com/kisaragi-hiu/emacs-japanese-kana"))
#+end_src

Then the input method =japanese-kana= and =japanese-kana-katakana= should both be available.

** License

GPLv3. The key part of Kana-Kanji conversion is also just taken straight from the builtin Japanese input method.
